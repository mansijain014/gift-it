# Gift-It

## Inspiration:-
Gifts represent expressions of love, gratitude, appreciation, etc. Putting a smile on the next person's face is more than enough motivation to give a gift and make you give more. So we decided to create a platform where people can easily exchange & donate gifts that they don't actually need. This will help in sustainable gift exchange & promoting charity.

## What it does:-
It is basically a gift exchange & donation app. Sometimes during festivals & holidays, we receive some gifts which we don't actually need. So our application helps users in exchanging and donating such gift items. Also, each time a user donates something, he/she receives some credit points that they can use for shopping from their favorite platforms.

## How we built it:-
Languages, Platforms & Frameworks used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, Redux Firebase etc.

## Challenges we ran into:-
We're all a team of beginners and we didn't have a lot of experience with all these languages and frameworks. So it was quite tough to learn all that and implement it in such a short span of time. But we finally did it!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:-
That we finally built an app using react where people can exchange their gifts and can donate if they wish to which leads to the activation of humanity. Also, we're proud that we learned a lot this weekend.

## What we learned:-
Itâ€™s not that easy to create an app the way it seems. It requires a good amount of hard work, patience, and time and leads you to learn and explore new things. We learned how to create a react app, how to use firebase for authentication and other backend stuff, how to register for a domain name, how to host & deploy react apps using Netlify, and a lot more.

## What's next for Gift It:-
We were not able to implement a chat and connect feature so we're planning on doing that. Also, we're planning to team up with shopping platforms so that our users can actually redeem and shop using the credit points.
